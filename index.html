    <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
    <p>There are many different air pollutants infiltrating our air, including PM 2.5, Ground-level Ozone, NO2, and more. PM 2.5 is one of the most prevalant air pollutants and can be detrimental to human health. Primary sources of PM 2.5 includes fuel combustion and car ehxaust. Health conditions such as health/respiratory issues and asthama can consequences of inhaling PM 2.5.</p>

    <h2>Air Quality and Inequality</h2>
    <p>Air quality in urban areas is generally worse than other settings. However, even within these urban settings, different groups of people experience the consequences of air quality in different ways. In New York City, many residential neighborhoods with primary populations of minority groups or lower income families experience air pollution at much higher rates. Below are two graphs, one about PM 2.5 and one about median household income. As shown in the graphs, correlation between lower income residential neighborhoods and lower air quality are apparent. </p>
